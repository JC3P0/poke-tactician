## 🚧 Project Status: Active Development

This project is currently in the planning and early implementation phase. Check back soon for updates!

## 📋 What is Poke-Tactician?

A full-stack web application that answers: **"Can my team beat this iconic Red/Blue trainer?"**

Build custom Gen 1 Pokemon teams and challenge legendary trainers from Pokemon Red/Blue (Gym Leaders, Elite Four, Champion Blue). The system uses **Dynamic Programming** to find optimal battle strategies using authentic Gen 1 game mechanics.

### Why Gen 1?

Generation I mechanics are unique, quirky, and historically significant:
- **DVs (0-15)** instead of modern IVs (0-31)
- **Unified Special stat** (no Sp.Atk/Sp.Def split)
- **Speed-based critical hits** (not random!)
- **Type-based Physical/Special** (determined by move type)
- **The Ghost vs Psychic bug** (Ghost deals ×0 to Psychic!)
- **15 types** (no Dark, Steel, or Fairy)

This project implements these mechanics with academic rigor and proper citations.

## 🎯 Planned Features

- 🔢 **Authentic Gen 1 Mechanics** - DVs, Special stat, speed crits, type glitches
- 🏆 **13 Boss Trainers** - All Red/Blue Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion Blue
- ⚡ **Dynamic Programming Optimizer** - Find optimal move sequences
- 📊 **Algorithm Comparison** - DP vs Greedy baseline
- 🎮 **Battle Visualizer** - Animated turn-by-turn playback
- 📱 **Team Builder** - Full Gen 1 customization (DVs, EVs, movesets)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React or Vanilla JavaScript
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Gen 1 Pokemon data from PokéAPI)
- **Algorithms:** Dynamic Programming, Greedy (baseline)

---

## 📚 Academic Context

This project is being developed for a **Data Structures & Algorithms** course with emphasis on:
- Proper algorithm citations (Bulbapedia, Smogon, academic papers)
- Performance analysis (Big-O complexity, benchmarks)
- Dynamic Programming implementation and optimization
- Clean code architecture and documentation

All Pokemon mechanics are cited from authoritative community sources (Bulbapedia, Smogon, Pokemon Speedruns Wiki).

---

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1:** Core Gen 1 mechanics (stats, damage, type effectiveness)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Battle engine (turn execution, KO handling)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Dynamic Programming optimizer
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Frontend UI and visualization
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Testing, benchmarks, deployment
